# EzMart - Django Ecommerce Web
## A full-scale fullstack school project, a mock online platform for buying and selling goods.

## * The project files are under the 'master' branch. *

## General Information
The site was inspired by the need to reduce the risk of shopping outside during the Covid-19 lockdown, and as such aims to be a user-friendly platform for shopping
and/or setting up a personal shop.
The platform enables users to browse local indie shops that cater to their day-to-day needs (such as foods, clothing, etc.) while also being a lightweight
user-friendly opportunity for shopowners to set up an online platform to sell their merchandise. 

This was my group's project for the course "Basics of Software Engineering" that included a fullstack approach to coding, as well as 
extensive documentation in the form of a project charter.
The tasks were tracked using Meistertask, and version control was done using Github.

# Technologies:
2. VSCode 
3. Django web framework
4. Python 3.3 or later
5. django extensions - Attached is a Requirements file

        
# Installation and running:
1. Extract the project files into a designated folder.
2. On a cmd running the project path, run the command:
    -m pip install -r requirements.txt		(Best to run as admin!)
3. To run the project, navigate to where the folder 'manage.py' is located
4. run "python manage.py runserver".
3. This should result in the shell correctly displaying that the server is running, while linking the localhost IP address
   for the project: 127.0.0.1
4. Enter the IP in your local browser (preferably chrome), and browse the site!


## Project status: 
No longer being worked on. This project was the first hands-on approach to fullstack coding our team had, and will stay with no further development as the members of the team moved on to other projects.

## Acknowledgements
This was part of my "Basics of Software Engineering" course, and as such I must thank my lecturer Ms. Hadas Chassidim.
